# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Objective:-

Handwritten digit recognition system using MNIST which basically detects the scanned images.In this project i had focused on the scanned images of handwritten digit recognition by using MNIST.

Tools used:-
- Jupyter Notebook

Insights:-

- The results were impressive! The trained model achieved an accuracy of showcasing its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen handwritten digits.
- This project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning and computer vision but also highlighted the power of deep learning in solving real-world challenges.
Thank you Bharat Intern for providing such an amazing oppportunity to enhance my skills.
